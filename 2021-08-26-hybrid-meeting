## Meeting rooms

We have a number of meeting rooms at the DCCN for meetings ranging from about 5 to 20 people. We commonly use these for group meetings where someone might present, but the interaction between all attendees is relatively symmetric and there is a lot of discussion. This is a many-to-many setup.

Since the meeting rooms are rectangular and have a rectangular table, the meetings have a U-shaped seating arrangement. The two long sides of the table have the most chairs, the side furthest away from the projection screen wall has a few chairs. The majority of the people present in real-life need to turn sideways to look at the projection screen.

### Mid-sized room (Oval Office)

The DCCN Oval Office is a medium sized room that can comfortably hold approximately 10 to 20 people. The setup consists of an oval table (hence the name) with chairs directly around it, with a second row of tables along the walls. There is a beamer that projects onto one of the short walls, and there are two speakers along that wall. 

The room also has a presentation computer that is hooked up to the beamer and room audio, and to the [Meeting Owl](http://owllabs.com/) that is placed in the middle of the table.

You can also connect your own laptop to the LCD screen and audio using a HDMI cable or using a VGA cable and select that as the source on the [AMX switch panel](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=audio-video).

### Smaller meeting rooms (Levelt, Adelbertus, Friston, Kutas, Cajal)

We have a number of meeting rooms at the DCCN that accomodate about 10 people. The setup  usually consists of a large rectangular, with a large LCD television screen and speakers along one of the short walls.

These rooms also have a general purpose presentation computer that is hooked up to the LCD screen and room audio, and to the [Meeting Owl](http://owllabs.com/) that is placed on the middle of the table.

You can also connect your own laptop to the LCD screen and audio using a HDMI cable and select that as the source on the [AMX switch panel](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=audio-video).

### How to run a IRL meeting

For reference, prior to the COVID pandemic, we would usually run meetings in which only few people would bring a laptop. The host or presenter would log in on the desktop PC with their DCCN account, or run the presentation from their own laptop. The presenter would use the large projection or LCD screen on the wall, and the attendees would switch attention between the screen (looking sideways) and the other attendees at the table. 

### How to run a hybrid meeting

For hybrid meetings in the smaller rooms we assume that people attending in real life and people attending online are equally important. The host is assumed to be present in real life as somebody needs to open the room and set it up. The presenter and/or discussion partners could be either working from home, or be present in real life.

The recommended procedure is:

1. Everybody that attends in real-life brings a laptop
2. The host starts the online meeting on his/her laptop
3. The host joins the online meeting on the general purpose desktop PC
4. The real-life attendants join the meeting on their laptop
5. The online attendants join the meeting on their laptop at home
6. Presentations and/or screen sharing are done from the individuals' laptop 

The general observation is that everyone attending needs to distribute their attention between three things: the people that are present IRL, the people that are present online, and the presentation or shared screen. Important is that all attendees (either IRL or online) can see each other mutually well.

The Meeting Owl on the middle of the table is used as 360-degree camera and as speaker. The sound coming from the middle of the table (instead of from the wall) gives the online attendants a better presence in the room. The host and all IRL attendees that join the meeting on their laptop must mute the microphone and speakers from their laptop to prevent feedback. All audio should go over the meeting room desktop presentation computer and the Meeting Owl.

The IRL attendees with a laptop in front of them switch attention between the shared presentation (on their laptop), the online attendees (on their laptop) and the other attendees at the table. Shifting attention between online attendees and people present IRL only requires glancing at or over the laptop screen, but does not require a 90-degree turn. Since the Meeting Owl is in the middle of the table, either looking at the laptop screen or to people on the other side of the table will result in a gaze directed approximately to the 360-degree camera AND to their own laptop webcam. Consequently, for participants joining from home the IRL person is still looking in their general direction. 

The meeting room presentation computer attached to the wall-mounted projection or LCD screen does not really have to be used in hybrid meetings, except by those IRL attendees that did not bring their own device. They can follow the presentation and online attendees on the wall-mounted projection or LCD screen. 

For IRL attendees without their own device, it is harder to observe detailled facial expressions of online attendees, and the online attendees will also not be able to see these IRL participants well. In case an IRL attendee talks to one of the online attendees, the IRL attendee will be probably be looking at the wall-mounted projection screen and hence the online attendee will see the speaking person (via the 360-degree camera) looking sideways. Furthermore, people that did not bring their own device cannot follow the online chat, cannot follow URLs that are posted there, and cannot influence the layout and/or size of the presentation on the wall-mounted screen, and the layout and/or size of the video of the online attendees. 

## Large conference room (Red Room)

The large colloquium room in the DCCN has about 100 seats, plus an additional 20 seats on the balcony. The Red Room is commonly used for lectures and presentations where one central person addresses the audience, where the audience ask questions, and where the audience does not interact directly among themselves. This is a one-to-many setup. 

The video/audio presentation setup is rather sophisticated and hence complex. There is a general purpose presentation desktop computer that is hooked up to the beamer and the two LCD screens in the lectern. The presentation computer also connects to the room audio. You can connect your own laptop using HDMI or VGA and select that as the source on the [AMX iPad](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=audio-video). 

Besides the computer as an audio source, there is a gooseneck microphone mounted on the lectern, a wireless headset microphone, and a wireless hand-held microphone.

There is a webcam mounted on the lectern.

There is an [Epiphan](https://www.epiphan.com) video capture and streaming device with an analog camera mounted on the balcony that gives an overview of the stage, including the presenter and the large projection screen.

### How to run a hybrid lecture/presentation

The recommended procedure is

1. The host or presenter brings a laptop, but does not connect it to HDMI or VGA
2. The online meeting is started on the host's or presenter's laptop
3. The presentation computer joins the online meeting with the name "Red Room"
4. The presentation can be run either from the laptop or from the presentation computer

The general observation is that the attendees mostly pay attention to the presenter and his/her presentation, not to each other. The presenter should be able to see and hear all IRL and online attendees. The IRL and online attendees have to hear each other (in case of questions) but don't have to see each other.

The host or presenter and all other IRL attendees that join the meeting on their laptop must mute the microphone and speakers from their laptop to prevent feedback. All audio goes over the Red Room presentation computer and over the PA system.

The online attendees will see the shared screen from the laptop or from the Red Room presentation computer. The online attendees hear the combined sound from all microphones and from the laptop or from the Red Room presentation computer through the online meeting software. The IRL attendees also hear the combined sound from all microphones and from the laptop or from the Red Room presentation computer, but through the PA system speakers.

TO BE FURTHER DISCUSSED:

- how is the PA system implemented?
- the gooseneck microphone on the lectern is not feeding into any computer
- the wireless headset and hand-held microphones are not feeding into any computer
- there is no microphone that picks up questions from the IRL audience
- there is no webcam pointing at the audience, online attendees cannot see the IRL audience
- how are questions from the online audience fed into the PA system speakers?

## Instruction rooms 

These rooms are commonly used for teaching, combining lecturing with hands-on computer excercises. This is a one-to-many setup.

The instruction rooms have a desk for the lecturer with a desktop presentation computer and the possibility to connect a laptop over HDMI or VGA. 

The instruction rooms have a gooseneck microphone mounted on the lecturers desk, a wireless headset microphone and a wireless hand-held microphone. 

The instruction rooms also have an [Epiphan](https://www.epiphan.com) video capture and streaming device with an analog camera mounted at the ceiling in the back of the room, giving an overview of the lecturer and the screen. 

### Large instruction room (1.160)

This room has 38 desks with a desktop computer (6 rows with 5 desks and 2 rows with 4 desks). Furthermore, there is a central section where the 38 participants can sit, facing the lecturer. 

### Small instruction room (2.258)

This room has 20 desk with a desktop computer (5 rows with 4 desks). The room is organized as a traditional class room with the  participants facing the lecturer. 

### How to organize hybrid teaching

Hybrid lecturing to attendees that are present IRL and online attendees requires that the attendees can hear the lecturer, but also the other attendees (e.g. if someone asks a question). Questions from online attendees should also be audible to everyone in the room. 

The lecturer and all other IRL attendees that join the meeting on their laptop must mute the microphone and speakers from their laptop to prevent feedback. All audio should go over the instruction room desktop presentation computer and over the PA system.


TO BE FURTHER DISCUSSED:

- how is the PA system implemented?
- there is no webcam pointing at the lecturer
- the gooseneck microphone on the lecturers desk is not feeding into any computer
- the wireless headset and hand-held microphones are not feeding into any computer
- there is no microphone that picks up questions from the IRL audience
- there is no webcam pointing at the audience, online attendees cannot see the IRL audience
- how are questions from the online audience fed into the PA system speakers?

## Small huddle rooms

We also have a number of small huddle rooms that accomodate 2-4 people. These don't have names like the others, and they cannot be reserved. These rooms are typically used to meet with a few people.

There is a general purpose presentation computer and a wall-mounted LCD screen with a webcam on top of it. You can also connect your own laptop to the LCD screen and audio using a HDMI cable and select that as the source on the [AMX switch panel](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=audio-video).

## When and how to use the Epiphan

The [Epiphan](https://www.epiphan.com) in the Red Room and in the instruction rooms can be used for unidirectional streaming (e.g. to YouTube) or for recordings (e.g. to record a lecture that can be shared on Brightspace). It allows people online to look along (with ~30 seconds delay), but is not really of use for questions and interaction with the online attendees. Its use is independent from the tools and software that might be used for an online or hybrid meeting. Due to the delay it is not suited for hybrid interaction.
